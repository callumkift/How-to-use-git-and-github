How-to-use-git-and-github
=========================

This repository holds files whilst following the Udacity course 'How to use Git and GitHub'. It doesn't have the 
reflections that was asked of in the class, instead I made files that I consider impportant. These include:

git_help.txt: Commands and ideas used in git.
github.txt: How to setup remote repositories in GitHub and how to use use them from the command line with the locals.

amongst over things that I thought would be important to refer back to later.
