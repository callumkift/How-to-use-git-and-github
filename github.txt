How to 'link' local repository to GitHub
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------



Setting up a remote
-------------------

A repository on GitHub is known as a remote - as it is not on one's local
system. One can see what remote repositories are connected to one's local
repository with the command

*) 'git remote'

If this command returns nothing, then there is no remote repository
connected to the local git repository. To add a remote repository, one 
needs to add a repository on GitHub and name it. One will then be given 
the info to add this remote repository to the local one. The command to
add this remote repository is

*) 'git remote add remoteName remoteRepoURL'

where one can call remoteName whatever one pleases - if there is only one
remote associated with your local repository, it is custom to call it
'origin'. The remoteRepoURL is given on GitHub once the remote has been 
corrected.

Running 'git remote' again should now give an output of 'remoteName'. For
more information about the remote, the command 

*) 'git remote -v'

should be used, here '-v' stands for verbose. This will show the url that
the local fetches data from and the url it pushes data to. Normally these
will be the same.

Pushing to your remote
----------------------

To push to your remote, i.e. to send all new commits to the remote, one 
uses the command

*) 'git push remoteName branchName'

where remoteName is the name given to your remote when it was setup and 
branchName is the branch one wants to push.
