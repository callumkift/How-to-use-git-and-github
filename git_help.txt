---------------------------------------------
All of the below can be found at 'git --help'
---------------------------------------------

'git clone ' + url: this clones the git repository that is at the url

'git log' : this shows the history of the commits

'git diff ' + commit1 commit2: this shows the differences between two 
		commits

'git checkout ' + commit#: this will take you back to that version

'git checkout origins/HEAD': this takes you back to your latest version

'git init': this initialises the repository you are in and makes it 
		'git-able'

-- Before making the commit, git puts the files to be committed in a 
-- 'staging area' and then all files in this staging area will be 
-- committed at the same time.

'git add': adds a file to the staging area

-- We can view the differences between all three pieces in the git model,
-- by this I mean the working directory, the staging area and the git 
-- repository. 

'git diff': this compares the working directory with the staging area
'git diff --staged': this compares the staging area and the repository
'git diff commit1 commit2': compares two commits in the repository

'git reset --head': this deletes all things that have not been committed
			and obviously none of these changes will have
			been saved

-- We can branch off the 'master branch' to try experimental features etc
-- and any changes to the new branch will not affect the master branch. 
-- These branches can then be rejoined later, merged. 

'git branch': This shows which branches you have in your repository, if
		there are more than one branch, the current branch that 
		you are working in will be denoted with a '*'

'git branch' + name: This creates a new branch at this point, called name
'git checkout' + branchName: This changes which branch you are working on
