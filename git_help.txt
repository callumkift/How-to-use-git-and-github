All of the below can be found at 'git --help'
---------------------------------------------

'git clone ' + url: this clones the git repository that is at the url

'git log' : this shows the history of the commits

'git diff ' + commit#old commit#new: this shows the differences between two commits

'git checkout ' + commit#: this will take you back to that version

'git checkout origins/HEAD': this takes you back to your latest version

'git init': this initialises the repository you are in and makes it 'git-able'

Before making the commit, git puts the files to be committed in a 'staging area' and then
all files in this staging area will be committed at the same time.

'git add': adds a file to the staging area
